#  Atlantic City finally has a second casino to challenge Las Vegas

Atlantic City's casino industry is about to get a lot more competitive.

Hard Rock International is set to open the doors of its new casino resort on June 28, putting an end to the city's monopoly on gambling. Atlantic City has long been the only place in New Jersey where you could gamble, but that is changing as Pennsylvania and Delaware both offer casinos as well.

The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Atlantic City is located on the Boardwalk and will feature 2,200 slot machines, 120 table games, and a 200-seat rock 'n' roll showroom. The hotel has 797 rooms and suites.

"We are excited to open our doors and welcome guests starting on June 28," said Jim Allen, CEO of Hard Rock International. "This property represents a completely new era and vision for Hard Rock in the Northeast and sets us up for continued success in this important market."

The opening of the Hard Rock comes at a time when Atlantic City is seeing a resurgence in popularity. The city's motto is now "Do AC" as opposed to "Just Say No", and there are new hotels and restaurants popping up all over town.

Some experts are predicting that the arrival of Hard Rock will cause a sharp decline in business for the city's other casino resorts. But others believe that there is enough business to go around for everyone.

When Atlantic City's newest casino, the Golden Nugget, opened its doors in late August, one of the first people to test his luck at the slot machines and tables was professional poker player Phil Ivey.

Ivey didn't waste any time in proving that he is one of the best players in the business: by the end of his first day at the casino, he had already won over $800,000.

"This place is amazing," said Ivey after his big win. "There are so many games to choose from and so much money to be made. I can't wait to come back and do even better."

The Golden Nugget is now home to one of the largest poker rooms on the East Coast, and Ivey plans to make regular appearances there in order to take advantage of the large pots and juicy side bets on offer.

Atlantic City has been without a top-notch poker room since Revel Casino closed down in 2014, so Ivey's arrival is definitely good news for fans of the game. With Ivey in town, they can expect some exciting high-stakes matchups between some of the best players in the world.

#  Atlantic City casino beats Las Vegas in poker player earnings

The city of Las Vegas has long been known as the gambling capital of the world. However, a recent study by The Street shows that Atlantic City casinos are now earning more from poker players than casinos in Las Vegas.

The Street’s analysts used information from Poker Industry PRO to determine that in 2017, Atlantic City casinos earned $151 million from poker, while Las Vegas casinos only earned $141 million. This is the first time that Atlantic City has beaten Las Vegas in this category.

What could be causing this shift? One possible explanation is that Atlantic City’s casinos have been making a concerted effort to attract poker players in recent years. In addition to offering a wide variety of games and tournaments, Atlantic City casinos have also been investing in new technology that allows players to compete against each other online.

Las Vegas casinos may soon need to start paying attention to their competitors in the east coast if they want to stay on top. In recent years, Las Vegas has been dealt some major blows as casino revenues have steadily declined. The city is now looking for new ways to bring in money, and poker may not be enough.

#  Second casino in the world for poker player opens in Atlantic City

Atlantic City, New Jersey is now the home to two casinos specifically catering to poker players. The Borgata, which has been a major player in the Atlantic City casino market since 2003, opened its Poker Lounge in January of this year. Admission to the lounge is free for hotel guests and $60 for those not staying at the Borgata.

The lounge offers 38 tables and a variety of cash games and tournaments. Tournaments range in buy-in from $27 to $2,000 and offer prizes up to $100,000. The Poker Lounge also offers a VIP program that gives members access to special tournaments, concierge service, and other perks.

In March of this year, the Resorts Casino Hotel opened its own poker room. The Resorts Casino Hotel was originally built as a bingo hall in 1978 but has since been remodeled into a full-fledged casino. The new poker room has 12 tables and offers both cash games and tournaments. Tournament buy-ins range from $20 to $530 and offer prizes up to $25,000.

Atlantic City's resurgence as a poker destination comes as no surprise to many experts. In 2013, New Jersey became the third state in the United States (after Nevada and Delaware) to legalize online poker. This has allowed New Jersey poker players to compete against each other on a wide variety of online sites.

The opening of the Borgata's Poker Lounge and the Resorts Casino Hotel's poker room comes at an opportune time for Atlantic City as it faces increasing competition from casino resorts in Pennsylvaniaand New York.

Atlantic City's newest casino is already paying off for one lucky poker player.

The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, recently won a whopping $271,000 at the Borgata Casino.

The big win came after just two hours of playing poker at the new casino.

"I'm still in shock," the player said in a statement released by the Borgata. "I can't believe this actually happened."

This victory is just the latest in a long line of successes for the player, who has been playing professionally for six years.

In fact, the winnings from this one session are already enough to cover all of the player's losses from the past year.

"I'm really excited to see what I can do with this money," the player said. "I may even take a vacation."

The Borgata Casino is one of Atlantic City's newer casinos, having opened its doors in 2003. It is owned by MGM Mirage and features more than 2,000 slot machines and 120 table games.
