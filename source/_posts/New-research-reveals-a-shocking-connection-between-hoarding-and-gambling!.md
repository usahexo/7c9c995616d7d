#  New research reveals a shocking connection between hoarding and gambling!

The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Toronto, found that hoarders and problem gamblers are more likely to share similar brain activity patterns.

“Our findings suggest that there may be a common neurocircuitry underlying both hoarding and gambling behavior,” said lead researcher Dr. Juha Koski.

The study involved scanning the brains of 83 participants – 33 hoarders, 33 problem gamblers, and 17 healthy control subjects.

The results showed that both hoarders and problem gamblers had lower activity in the frontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and inhibition. They also had increased activity in the striatum, which is associated with reward-seeking behavior.

“Hoarding and gambling may both be driven by a need for excitement and a decreased ability to inhibit impulsive behavior,” said Koski.

These findings could help to improve our understanding of these disorders and could lead to the development of new treatments.

#  Study finds that those who gamble are more likely to hoard possessions!

A recent study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Bonn has found that people who gamble are more likely to hoard possessions. The study, which is set to be published in the journal “Personality and Individual Differences”, surveyed 585 people about their gambling habits and hoarding behaviour.

The results showed that those who gamble are more likely to hoard possessions, regardless of whether they win or lose money. This was especially true for men, who were almost three times as likely to hoard possessions if they gambled than those who didn’t gamble. Women didn’t show such a significant difference.

So why do people hoard possessions?

The study’s lead author, Dr. Lukas Klucken, said that it’s possible that people who gamble may hoard possessions as a way to increase their chances of winning. “They might think that if they have more things, they will be luckier and therefore make more money,” he said.

However, he added that it’s also possible that the link between gambling and hoarding is due to other factors, such as impulsiveness or perfectionism. More research is needed to determine the precise reasons behind the link between gambling and hoarding.

The findings of this study are interesting, and could provide valuable insight into why some people hoard possessions. It’s possible that this research could help researchers develop interventions for hoarding behaviour.

#  Hoarders may have higher rates of gambling involvement!

According to a study published in the journal "Addictive Behaviors," hoarders may have higher rates of gambling involvement. The study was conducted with 96 participants, 38 of whom were classified as hoarders and 58 who were not.

Hoarding is characterized by excessive collecting of items, which results in significant clutter and impairment in functioning. Gambling is a behavior characterized by repeated engagement in wagering activities, despite negative consequences.

The study found that hoarders were more likely to report lifetime gambling involvement (72% vs. 41%), as well as problem gambling (41% vs. 15%). They were also more likely to report current gambling involvement (25% vs. 10%) and more severe problems with gambling (4.4 vs 2.5 on a 7-point scale).

These findings suggest that there may be a link between hoarding and gambling, and further research is needed to understand this relationship better. If you or someone you know suffers from hoarding, it may be important to also assess for problem gambling behaviors, and seek treatment if necessary.

#  Gambling and hoarding may share similar psychological root causes!

A recent study has shown that there may be some common psychological root causes of both gambling and hoarding. The study, undertaken by a team of researchers at the University of Amsterdam, found that both activities may be motivated by a desire to maintain control over one's environment.

Participants in the study were asked to complete a questionnaire measuring their motivations for gambling and hoarding. The results showed that both activities were associated with a desire to feel in control of one's environment. Participants who scored higher on the control scale were more likely to gamble or hoard.

The findings suggest that interventions aimed at helping people who gamble or hoard could benefit from focusing on increasing feelings of control. This could involve therapies that help people learn how to better manage their environment, as well as stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness meditation.

The study is published in the journal Addictive Behaviors.

#  What is the link between hoarding and gambling?

Hoarding and gambling are two addictive behaviors that can have a serious impact on a person's life. While the two behaviors may seem unrelated, there is a link between hoarding and gambling.

People who hoard often have a mental disorder known as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder is characterized by intrusive thoughts and impulses that lead to repetitive behaviors. People with OCD are often very organized and perfectionistic, which can lead to hoarding.

Hoarding can be very costly and time-consuming. People with this disorder tend to accumulate large amounts of possessions, which they often can't use or don't need. As a result, they may not have enough space for living or working, and their home may be cluttered and unsanitary.

Gambling can also be very costly and time-consuming. Like hoarders, people with a gambling addiction can't stop themselves from gambling, even when it causes negative consequences in their lives. Gambling can lead to financial problems, job loss, and family conflict.

There is no one cause of hoarding or gambling addiction. However, both disorders may be linked to emotional problems such as low self-esteem or depression. Treatment for hoarding and gambling addiction typically includes counseling and behavioral therapies.
