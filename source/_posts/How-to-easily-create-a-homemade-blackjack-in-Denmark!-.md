#  How to easily create a homemade blackjack in Denmark! 

A blackjack is a fun and easy game to make at home! All you need is a deck of cards, two people, and some snacks! This guide will teach you how to play blackjack and how to easily create your own homemade blackjack in Denmark.

## The Basics of Blackjack 
The aim of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player and the dealer are both dealt two cards each. The player can then choose to either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they have). If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. If the dealer goes over 21, the hand is a push (a draw). The winner is the person who either has the highest total if both players have not busted, or the player who busts last if both players have busted.

There are a few other things to keep in mind:
- Aces can be counted as 1 or 11, depending on what works best for you.
- 10s and face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are all worth 10 points.
- If you have two cards of the same value (eg two 8s), you can split them into two separate hands.
- If the dealer has an Ace showing, they will offer insurance against the possibility of a blackjack (an Ace and a 10). You can choose whether or not to take this insurance - it's essentially gambling on whether or not the dealer will get blackjack. 

## Playing Blackjack 

Now that you know the basics of blackjack, it's time to learn how to play! In Denmark, we generally use one deck of cards for each player - so for two players, we'll need two decks. Shuffle both decks together and place them in front of the first player. They should cut the pack so that about half of it is placed face down in front of them, and then deal one card face up onto this pile from their left hand - this is their first card. The dealer then does exactly the same thing - dealing one card face up from their left hand to represent their first card. 

Now it's time for some decisions! The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible - but remember, if you go over 21 you bust! In general, we want to keep hitting until we either reach 21 or go bust. So if our first card is anything other than an Ace, we'll usually hit on all subsequent cards unless told otherwise by our second card (for example, if our first card is an 8 and our second card is a 2 then we would stop hitting since 8 + 2 = 10 which is already close enough to 21). 

If our first card IS an Ace however, we have a choice: should we count it as 1 or 11? This depends on what works best for us - but as a rule of thumb, if we're aiming for a low total we'll count it as 1 (so our total becomes 12) while if we're aiming for a high total we'll count it as 11 (so our total becomes 22). Now let's say our first two cards are an Ace and a 3 - counting the Ace as 1 gives us 12 while counting it as 11 gives us 22. We now have two options: either stick with 12 or keep hitting in order to try and reach 22. In most cases it's best just to stick with 12 - but if we think that by continuing we could reach 22 without going bust then go ahead and hit!

Now let's say that instead of an Ace + 3 combination our first two cards are an Ace + 7 combination. Again, counting the Ace as 1 gives us 12 while counting it as 11 gives us 22. So now do we stick with 12 or hit in order to try and reach 22? In this case it's probably better to hit since there's a higher chance of reaching 22 without going bust than there was before. But always bear in mind your total when making these decisions!

Once all players have made all their decisions, everyone reveals their cards simultaneously. The player with the highest total takes all of the banknotes from those who finished lower than them (bust doesn't count), and removes their chips from play.. If there's still more than one player with the same high total,,then they divide up equally whatever money is left..The dealer takes any money won by players apart from themselves,,and pays any losers apart from themselves out of his own pocket.. PLAYER BANKNOTES: 0 DANISH KRONER: 0 DEALER'S CARD: K
The game starts again following these new exchanges,,with PLAYER 1 now receiving 2 new banknotes ($10) added into play,,and PLAYER 2 receiving no new banknotes but losing $10 worth from his chips which now reads $40 remaining..Now

#  Create a professional-looking blackjack at home with these simple steps 
With a few household items and a little bit of creativity, you can create a professional-looking blackjack table for your next home game. Here are the simple steps:

1. Start by measuring the dimensions of your playing area and cutting a piece of plywood to that size. If you're lucky enough to have a piece of lumber lying around, you can use that instead.

2. Paint or stain the plywood to whatever color you like. We recommend black to create a classic look.

3. Next, cut out two circles from another piece of plywood or lumber that are slightly larger than the size of your playing area. One will be used as the base and the other will be used as the top of the table.

4. Attach the top circle to the base with screws or nails. Make sure it's sturdy so it won't move around while playing.

5. Using a jigsaw, router, or drill, cut out four small holes in each corner of the top circle for players to put their hands through.

6. Finally, add some accessories like cup holders, wood trim, and felt padding to finish off the table. You can find these at your local hardware store or online.

#  How to make a blackjack using household items 

This guide will show you how to make a blackjack game using common household items.

You will need:
– One deck of playing cards
– A small piece of paper
– A pen or pencil

To make the game, first shuffle the deck and then deal out ten cards face down on the table. These are your player cards. Next, deal one card face up in the center of the table. This is your dealer card. remaining cards are placed in a stack face down next to the dealer card. 
Your aim in the game is to beat the dealer by collecting cards with a point total higher than that of the dealer, without going over 21. Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each, an Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their numeric value.
Once you have been dealt your cards, take a moment to calculate your point total. If it is below 21, you may hit (draw another card) or stand (decline any further draws). If your point total exceeds 21, you have busted and lose automatically. If you draw a card which takes your total over 21, this is also called a bust and is an automatic loss. 
When both you and the dealer have finished drawing cards, whoever has the highest point total wins – unless both players have busted, in which case it’s a draw).

The player with the highest point total at the end of the hand wins!

#  How to make a sturdy and fun blackjack game for your next party

This article will teach you how to make a blackjack game that is both sturdy and fun.

To start, you will need the following materials:

-A piece of cardboard or a foam board

-A ruler or a straight edge

-A pencil
 October 2017
-Scissors
-One deck of playing cards
-Paint or markers in black and red
-A white adhesive label or a white sticker

 1. To make the playing surface, use the ruler or straight edge to draw a rectangle on the cardboard or foam board that is 18 inches long and 9 inches wide.  2. Next, use the scissors to cut out the playing surface.  3. Now, it is time to create the markers for player bets. On the adhesive label or sticker, write "Blackjack" in large letters. Divide the remaining space into four equal squares. Within each square, write "$5," "$10," "$25" and "$100."  4. Paint or marker the spaces on the playing surface black, making sure to avoid getting any paint on the edges of the board.  5. Once the paint dries, place the playing surface face down on your work surface. Carefully turn over so that the Blackjack title is facing up. Stick each betting marker in its corresponding square on the playing surface.

  6 Now it's time to deal with creating a deck of cards for your game. . If you want to be really fancy and have professional looking cards, you can buy card stock from a craft store or office supply store, but this is not necessary.. Cut out two rectangles from cardboard that are 6 inches wide and 9 inches long (or use foam board). These will be your card holders.. On one of these rectangles, use a pencil and ruler to draw 11 parallel lines that are each 1/2 inch apart.. Then use a pair of scissors to carefully cut along these lines (you may want to do this outside or over a trash can as there will likely be some little pieces of cardboard left over). This should create 12 small cards that are each 1/2 inch by 6 inches.. Do the same thing with the other rectangle, but Draw 22 parallel lines (instead of 11) to create 22 small cards that are also 1/2 inch by 6 inches.. You now have two card holders - one with 12 small cards and one with 22 small cards.. To make sure that your game functions correctly, take one deck of playing cards and cut it into two piles - one containing 52 cards and one containing 26 cards.. Shuffle each pile thoroughly and then place them face down in their respective card holders../ 7 Lastly,. it's time to add some finishing touches to your game. Use a black marker to draw an outline around each of the betting markers on the playing surface.. Also use a red marker to write "21" in large letters in the upper right hand corner of the playing surface.. Finally, give your game a name and label it accordingly (e.g., "Sturdy Blackjack Game").
