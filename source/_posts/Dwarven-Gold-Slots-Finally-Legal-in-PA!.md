#  Dwarven Gold Slots Finally Legal in PA!

Pennsylvania has legalized the use of gold-only slots in casinos across the state, a move that is expected to increase tourism and revenue.

The new law is seen as a win for the dwarven community, who lobbied for the change. "Dwarves love gold," said one advocate. "This will be a great opportunity for us to show our prowess at gambling."

Opponents of the bill say that it will create an unfair advantage for dwarven players, but supporters argue that the extra excitement will bring people from all over to try their luck.

So far, there has been no word on whether similar legislation will be passed in other states.

#  Online Gambling Ban Lifted in PA!

Pennsylvania's online gambling ban has been lifted as of Tuesday, November 21st. This means that all forms of gambling are now available to Pennsylvanians, both in-person and online.

The move comes as a bit of a surprise, as Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf had previously spoken out against lifting the ban. In a statement released shortly after the ban was lifted, Wolf said that he plans to work with the state legislature to create "a set of regulations that protect Pennsylvanians and ensure that our casinos and racetracks are best positioned to compete."

It's unclear exactly why Wolf has changed his stance on online gambling, but many believe that it has to do with the recent legalization of sports betting in Pennsylvania. With sports betting now available, Wolf may be worried that the state is losing out on potential tax revenue.

So far, there hasn't been much reaction from the public about the change in policy. It will be interesting to see what happens when people start realizing that they can now gamble online legally in Pennsylvania.

It's worth noting that not all forms of gambling are available yet. The websites of PA's casinos and racetracks have not yet been updated to reflect the change in policy. It's possible that they will not be updated until after Thanksgiving.

#  Pennsylvania Casinos to Offer Online Gambling Soon

Pennsylvania casinos soon will offer online gambling, according to a statement Wednesday from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.

The first step in the process is for the state’s 12 casinos to apply for interactive gaming licenses. The board has not announced when it will begin accepting those applications.

The move comes as the gaming industry deals with declining revenues from slot machines and table games.

The Pennsylvania Senate passed a bill in October that would have allowed online gambling, but it stalled in the House of Representatives. The measure would have allowed casinos to offer slots, blackjack, roulette and other games over the internet.

State Sen. Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, said he was confident that lawmakers would take up the issue again early in 2018.

Under the proposed bill, casino operators would be able to partner with companies outside of Pennsylvania to offer online gambling. Operators also could select one other entity to help them manage their interactive gaming operation. 

A spokeswoman for Las Vegas Sands Corp., which owns The Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, declined comment on Wednesday’s announcement.
