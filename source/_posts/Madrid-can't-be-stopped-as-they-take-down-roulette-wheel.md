#  Madrid can't be stopped as they take down roulette wheel

Madrid seemingly can't be stopped this season, as they continued their impressive form with a convincing 3-0 victory over a struggling Roulette Wheel side.

The home side were completely dominant in the opening exchanges, and it was no surprise when they took the lead after 24 minutes. Casemiro was the scorer, finishing well after a good team move.

Roulette Wheel pushed for an equaliser in the second half, but Madrid always looked dangerous on the break. They eventually made it 2-0 midway through the second period, as Gareth Bale finished coolly from close range.

The scoring was completed in the closing stages, as Isco found the net with a fine strike from outside the area.

Madrid now sit five points clear at the top of the table, and look like strong favourites to win the title.

#  Ronaldo scores twice as Madrid dismantle roulette wheel

Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid comprehensively beat APOEL Nicosia in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Ronaldo found the net in each half at the Santiago Bernabeu to take his tally to six goals in the competition this season - and 14 overall in all competitions.

The result leaves Madrid level on points with Tottenham Hotspur at the top of Group H, with two games remaining.

"We're doing well, we're top of the group but it's not over yet," said Ronaldo. "There are still two games to go and we have to win them."

Ronaldo has now overtaken Barcelona's Lionel Messi as the all-time record goalscorer in Europe's premier club competition.

Elsewhere in the group, Borussia Dortmund went second with a 2-1 win at home to Cyprus' APOEL, courtesy of goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

#  Bale, Modric lead Madrid to comfortable victory over roulette wheel

In the first leg of their Champions League semifinal matchup against Liverpool, Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric proved to be the mastermind in a 3-0 victory over roulette wheel.

Liverpool, who was without its injured top scorer Mohamed Salah, was unable to create any significant chances, while Gareth Bale scored twice and Modric added a goal late on to seal the win.

It was Bale’s first match since returning from an ankle injury and he looked sharp throughout, scoring with a header in the 10th minute and then converting a penalty in the 73rd minute.

Modric was also impressive, dictating the play from midfield and setting up both of Bale’s goals. He has now scored six goals in this year’s Champions League.

“We knew that it would be a very difficult game, but we played very well from the beginning and took control of the match,” said Modric.

Real Madrid coach Zinédine Zidane was also pleased with his side’s performance.

“We played a very serious game and took control from the start. We deserved to win by more, but 3-0 is still a good result,” said Zidane. “Bale is getting better every day and Gareth showed once again how important he is for us.”

With Liverpool having lost its last three games against Real Madrid, its chances of reaching the final appear to be increasingly slim.

#  Madrid cruising to another win against roulette wheel

#
There's no stopping this Spanish giant as they brushed aside yet another opponent, this time with a convincing victory against roulette wheel.

#  It was a one-sided matchup from the start, with Madrid dictating the pace and creating most of the chances. They were rewarded for their dominance in the 39th minute when Isco drilled a low shot past the keeper.

#  The second half was more of the same, as Madrid continued to control proceedings and sealed the win with a late goal from Ronaldo. This latest win sees them move up to second place in La Liga, just three points behind Barcelona.

#  It's been an impressive start to the season by Zidane's side, who have shown that they are capable of challenging for the title once again. They face a tough test next week when they take on Tottenham in the Champions League, but you can be sure that they will be looking to make a statement in that match.

#  Roulette wheel proves no match for rampant Madrid

A much-needed victory on the road against a tough opponent – this is what Real Madrid were looking for before their upcoming Champions League clash against PSG. And they got it, in emphatic style. The 3-0 victory over Sevilla was comprehensive, with goals from Casemiro, Kroos and Bale.

The outstanding performer on the day was undoubtedly Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese forward was a constant menace to the Sevilla defence, creating chances and scoring one goal.

Ronaldo’s low strike in the first half put Madrid ahead and his header in the second confirmed the victory. This result will give Zidane’s side plenty of confidence as they travel to Paris for their crunch tie next week.

There were some nervy moments towards the end of the match, but Madrid held on to record an important win. They now find themselves just two points behind Barcelona at the top of La Liga, with a game in hand over their title rivals.

It has been an up-and-down season for Real Madrid, but they are starting to show signs of real progress under Zidane. Their performances in Europe have been particularly impressive and they will be determined to reach the final this year.
