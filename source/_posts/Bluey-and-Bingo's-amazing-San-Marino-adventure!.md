#  Bluey and Bingo's amazing San Marino adventure!


This summer, Bluey and Bingo went on the trip of a lifetime to San Marino!

San Marino is a tiny country located in the Italian Alps. It's known for its stunning mountain scenery and for being the oldest republic in the world.

Bluey and Bingo had an amazing time exploring all that San Marino has to offer. They hiked in the mountains, explored ancient villages, visited beautiful churches and even went skiing!

They both agreed that it was an unforgettable experience and they can't wait to go back again someday!

#  Bingo has a dream about San Marino!

This morning I had a dream about San Marino. In my dream, I was standing in the main square of San Marino, and I saw the flag of San Marino waving in the breeze. As I looked at the flag, I felt a sense of joy and patriotism swelling up inside me. I then turned to look at the other flags of the world, and I noticed that they all seemed so small and insignificant compared to the flag of San Marino.

I then began to think about why San Marino is so special. I realized that it is because San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world. It is only 24 square miles in size, and it has a population of just over 32,000 people. This makes San Marino one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

Despite its small size, San Marino is a prosperous country. It has a GDP per capita of over $50,000, which is among the highest in the world. This is due to its strong economy, which is based on tourism, banking, and manufacturing.

What struck me most about my dream was how happy I felt standing in front of the flag of San Marino. It was as if all my problems had suddenly disappeared, and I was filled with a sense of joy and happiness. This shows how special San Marino is to me, and how much pride I feel for being a citizen of this wonderful country.
