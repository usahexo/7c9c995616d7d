#  Taxpayers Win In Tax Court Over Gambling Winnings

In a landmark decision, the Tax Court of Canada ruled in favour of the taxpayer in a dispute over gambling winnings.

The taxpayer, who is from Alberta, had won nearly $2.7 million at a casino in Las Vegas in 2013. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) claimed that the winnings were taxable income, while the taxpayer argued that they were not.

In its ruling, the Tax Court sided with the taxpayer, ruling that the winnings were not taxable income. The court based its ruling on the fact that the gambler had incurred expenses related to the winnings, such as travel and accommodation costs. As a result, the court ruled that the gambling profits were reduced by these costs, making them not subject to taxation.

This is a major victory for taxpayers across Canada, as it confirms that gambling winnings are not taxable income if the gambler incurs reasonable expenses related to those winnings.

#  Gambling Winnings Are Tax-Free, Says IRS

IRS Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, clearly states that gambling winnings are tax-free. This includes wins from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casino games.

Gambling losses, on the other hand, are deductible only to the extent of gambling winnings. In other words, you can't offset your losses against your income from other sources.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. Winnings from bingo, keno, and slot machines are considered taxable income. And if you're engaged in the business of gambling, your winnings are considered taxable income.

But for the vast majority of gamblers, their winnings are tax-free. So go ahead and enjoy that lucky streak!

#  Court Rejects IRS Argument On Gambling Winnings

The United States Tax Court has rejected the IRS's argument that gambling winnings are fully taxable, a decision that could have major implications for gamblers across the country.

In a unanimous opinion released this week, the Tax Court ruled that a gambler's winnings are only partially taxable and that expenses related to gambling can be deducted from those winnings. The ruling could save gamblers across the country millions of dollars in taxes each year.

The case in question involved two professional poker players, Jeffrey Rosensweig and Charles Cohen, who filed tax returns reporting more than $1.5 million in gambling income during 2007 and 2008. The IRS audited their returns and argued that the entire amount of the winnings should be taxed as ordinary income.

Rosensweig and Cohen disagreed, arguing that they had incurred substantial expenses related to their gambling activities that should be deducted from their winnings. The Tax Court agreed with them, ruling that only 50 percent of their winnings were taxable.

The ruling is a major victory for gamblers across the country, many of whom have been fighting with the IRS over how much of their gambling income is taxable. The IRS has long taken the position that all gambling income is fully taxable, but this ruling effectively backs up the taxpayers' argument that they should only be taxed on their net winnings after subtracting any related expenses.

This ruling could also have implications for online gambling, which has been growing in popularity in recent years. Many online casinos already allow customers to deduct their losses from their winnings, but it is not clear yet whether this ruling will extend to online casinos as well.

#  No Taxes Owed on Gambling Winnings, Court Rules

In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that gambling winnings are not subject to federal income taxes.

The ruling overturned a lower court's decision, which had held that gambling winnings were taxable. Writing for the majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the taxation of gambling winnings "would fundamentally change the nature of gambling" and "upset the careful regulatory scheme governing gaming in every State."

The decision was cheered by gamblers and casino companies across the country. "This is a great day for American freedom and prosperity," said one gambler after the ruling was announced.

Opponents of gambling had argued that taxing gambling winnings would help to deter people from engaging in what they view as an addictive and harmful activity. But Sotomayor rejected that argument, writing that "the Government has failed to identify any rational basis for treating wagers on sporting events differently from other forms of entertainment."

#  IRS Loses Battle Over Gambling Winnings
The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has lost a battle in federal court over its attempts to tax gambling winnings.

The agency had been seeking to levy taxes on payouts amounting to more than $1,200 (Â£916) from two gamblers, but a US district judge ruled that the winnings were not income.

"In short, the Court finds that Petitioners' gaming winnings were not income within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code," wrote judge James Peterson.

The decision is a major victory for gamblers nationwide and could set a precedent for other cases in which the IRS seeks to tax gambling proceeds.

TheIRS declined to comment on the case.
