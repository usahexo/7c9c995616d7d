#  Del Largo Casino much closer to Roseland than originally thought

The Del Largo Casino is much closer to Roseland than originally thought, according to the preliminary findings of an ongoing study by the University of Utah.

The study, which is being funded by the Del Largo Casino, found that the casino is only about 12 miles from Roseland, far closer than the 30-mile radius that had initially been presumed.

"This is great news for the casino and for Roseland," said Norma Mendoza, chair of the Del Largo Casino's board of directors. "We're looking forward to providing much-needed jobs and economic development to Roseland and the surrounding area."

Mendoza also noted that the casino will be a boon to tourism in the region, as it will offer a unique gaming experience that is not currently available in Utah.

The Del Largo Casino is expected to open in late 2019 or early 2020.

#  First 24 hours at the casino a huge success!

I just had my first 24 hours at the casino and it was a huge success! I arrived yesterday evening and was greeted by the friendly staff. After getting checked in, I went to my room to get settled in.

The room was really nice, and I was really impressed by the views of the Strip from my window. After taking a quick break to freshen up, I headed down to the casino floor.

The casino was absolutely massive, and there were so many games to choose from. I started with some blackjack, and managed to win a few hands. Then I moved on to roulette, and had some more success there.

By this point, I was feeling pretty confident, so I decided to try my luck at the slots. And guess what? I won $100 on my very first spin!

Overall, I had an amazing time at the casino, and I can't wait to go back again tomorrow. If you're looking for a fun and exciting vacation destination, then you should definitely check out the casino in Las Vegas!
