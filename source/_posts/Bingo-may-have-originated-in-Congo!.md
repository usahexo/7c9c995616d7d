#  Bingo may have originated in Congo!

The game of bingo is believed to have originated from a traditional Congolese game called ‘Mokele Mbembe’. This game is played by marking out squares on a paper sheet, with numbers in each square. Players take it in turns to call out numbers and, when they have a line of five numbers in a row, they shout ‘Bingo!’

The exact origins of bingo are unknown, but the game is thought to have first been played in Italy in the 16th century. It then spread to France and Germany, before eventually making its way to the United States. Bingo became popular in the US during World War II, as it was seen as a way for service members and their families to pass the time.

Today, bingo is enjoyed by people all over the world. There are many different variations of the game, including American Bingo, Australian Bingo and Swedish Bingo. In some countries, such as Belgium and Spain, bingo is even considered to be a national pastime!

#  Are you playing bingo the right way? Check out the Congolese version!

Bingo is a game that is enjoyed by people around the world. Although the game is pretty much the same wherever you play it, there are some regional variations. We're going to take a look at one such variation – Congolese bingo, or loto-bango as it is sometimes called.

The basic premise of the game is the same: Players mark off numbers on their cards as they are called out, and the first player to mark off all of their numbers wins. However, there are a few differences between Congolese bingo and traditional bingo.

For starters, in Congolese bingo there are usually six players, rather than the traditional five. In addition, cards are typically arranged in a diamond formation, with each player having four cards. Finally, there are a number of different bonus games that can be played in addition to the main game.

One such bonus game is known as fish-in-a-net. This game is played by marking off numbers on one's card in any order desired. After all of the numbers have been marked off, the player declares "fish-in-a-net" and all of the other players must then mark off the same number of numbers on their cards as the first player has declared. The player who finishes first then wins the pot.

Another popular bonus game is known as bombay taxi. This game is played by betting on particular combinations of numbers on one's card. After all of the numbers have been called, the player with the best combination of numbers wins the bet.

#  Bingo's popularity soars in Congo as new generations discover the game

For many years, bingo was known as a game primarily played in Western countries. But over the past decade or so, its popularity has been growing rapidly in other parts of the world, including Africa. In Congo, for example, new generations are discovering the game and are enjoying playing it in local bingo halls.

One reason for this trend is that bingo is a relatively easy game to learn how to play. It doesn't require any advanced skills or knowledge, and even young children can quickly pick up the basics. Additionally, bingo is a social game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, making it a popular choice for get-togethers and parties.

In Congo, there are now numerous dedicated bingo halls where players can come together to enjoy a few rounds of the game. And because of the country's growing population, these halls are often packed with players. Indeed, it's not unusual to see people queuing up to buy tickets and take their seats at a bingo table.

Bingo isn't just popular in Congo – it's becoming increasingly popular all over Africa. Countries such as Nigeria and Kenya have seen a surge in interest in the game in recent years, and there are now numerous dedicated bingo halls operating throughout the continent. So if you're looking for an exciting new way to spend your time while in Africa, be sure to give bingo a try!
