#  Bills find new way to tease fans with another close loss

It was déjà vu all over again for Bills fans on Sunday. Trailing by four points and driving for the potential game-winning touchdown in the final minutes of play, Buffalo once again came up just short, losing to the Jaguars by a score of 24-21.

The loss drops the Bills record to 2-5 on the season and leaves them mired in last place in the AFC East.

“Close losses are the worst,” said Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor. “You work so hard all week long and put everything you have into it, only to come up short in the end. It’s really tough to take.”

Bills fans have seen this story before. In each of their first five games, Buffalo has been within one score of their opponents in the fourth quarter. They’ve come up just short each time, however, resulting in a 2-5 record.

While there is still plenty of time left in the season, it’s beginning to look like another disappointing year in Buffalo. The Bills have not made the playoffs since 1999 and it doesn’t appear that this year will be any different.

In his postgame press conference, head coach Sean McDermott acknowledged that his team is “in a hole right now.” He added that they need to “find a way to win close games.”

For Bills fans, that phrase is all too familiar.

#  Bills can't seem to catch a break, fall to Jaguars in OT

The Buffalo Bills were looking for their first victory of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they weren't able to come away with the win. The Bills fell to the Jaguars in overtime by a score of 26-21.

The Bills started off strong in this game, scoring two touchdowns in the first quarter. The first touchdown was scored by LeSean McCoy on a 7-yard run. The second touchdown was scored by Charles Clay on a 10-yard pass from Tyrod Taylor. The Jaguars were able to score one touchdown in the first quarter, but it was not enough to keep up with the Bills.

In the second quarter, the Jaguars were able to score three touchdowns and take the lead over the Bills. The first touchdown was scored by Leonard Fournette on a 1-yard run. The second touchdown was scored by T.J. Yeldon on a 3-yard run. The third touchdown was scored by Marqise Lee on a 9-yard pass from Blake Bortles. This led to the Jaguars taking a 21-14 lead into halftime.

In the third quarter, neither team was able to score any points. However, in the fourth quarter, the Bills were able to tie up the game at 21 apiece with a rushing touchdown from McCoy and a passing touchdown from Taylor to Zay Jones. This led to the game going into overtime.

In overtime, it didn't take long for the Jaguars to score another touchdown and take home the victory. Bortles threw a 5-yard pass to Lee for the touchdown, giving them a 26-21 win over Buffalo.

This was yet another disappointing loss for Bills fans this season. They are now 0-5 and have had trouble scoring points all season long. They will look to get their first win of the season next week against Tampa Bay Buccaneers

#  Buffalo Bills fail to cover as 6-point favorites against Jacksonville Jaguars

In a game that was largely seen as a mismatch, the Buffalo Bills were unable to cover as 6-point favorites against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The Jaguars came into Week 3 with a 2-0 record, while the Bills sat at 1-1. The Bills were coming off of an impressive win against the Minnesota Vikings, while the Jaguars had barely scraped together wins against the Houston Texans and Tennessee Titans.

Buffalo started off strong, scoring first in the opening quarter on a 15-yard touchdown run by LeSean McCoy. However, they were unable to score again for the rest of the game. Meanwhile, Jacksonville scored 17 unanswered points to take a 17-7 lead into halftime.

The Bills made a valiant effort in the second half, but ultimately fell short. They were able to score 10 points in the third quarter, but it wasn’t enough as they lost 27-17.

This was an extremely disappointing performance from Buffalo, and it raises some serious questions about their legitimacy as contenders in the AFC. They will need to bounce back quickly if they want any chance of making the playoffs this season.

#  Jaguars get the best of Bills in matchup of two struggling teams

In a matchup of two struggling teams, the Jacksonville Jaguars got the best of the Buffalo Bills, 24-21. The Jaguars had been struggling for weeks, losing three of their last four games. The Bills had lost two in a row and four of their last five.

The Jaguars started off well, driving down the field on their opening possession and scoring on a Leonard Fournette touchdown run. The Bills responded with a touchdown drive of their own, but the Jaguars held them off the rest of the way to take a 10-7 lead into halftime.

In the second half, the Jaguars added to their lead with another touchdown run by Fournette. The Bills made a late charge, scoring twice in the final minutes to make it a one-score game, but they ran out of time.

Fournette led the way for Jacksonville with 111 yards rushing and two touchdowns. Blake Bortles was 28-of-38 for 329 yards and two touchdowns. For Buffalo, Tyrod Taylor was 20-of-37 for 234 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception.

This was an important win for Jacksonville, keeping them in playoff contention at 6-6. The Bills fall to 5-7 and are in danger of missing the playoffs for the 17th straight year.

#  Buffalo Bills let another one slip away, lose to Jacksonville in overtime

The Buffalo Bills had a golden opportunity to pick up a win on Sunday, but they let it slip away. The Bills lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars in overtime by a score of 20-17.

The Jaguars took the lead in the third quarter, but the Bills responded with a touchdown of their own to take back the lead. The Jaguars tied the game late in the fourth quarter, and then Buffalo kicker Steven Hauschka missed a 38-yard field goal that would have won the game at the end of regulation.

In overtime, the Jaguars won the coin toss and marched downfield for a touchdown to win the game. This was yet another heart-breaking loss for Buffalo, who have now lost four games this season in which they had a lead in the fourth quarter or overtime.

Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed 22 of 38 passes for 246 yards and one touchdown on Sunday. He also rushed for 34 yards on nine carries.
