#  Washington to Lower the Legal Gambling Age to 18 

 After a long and heated debate, the Washington state Senate has approved a bill that would allow people as young as 18 to gamble in the state’s casinos and card rooms.

The bill, which now goes to the House for approval, was introduced by Republican Senator Mike Padden of Spokane Valley. It passed on a 25-22 vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to increased addiction and social problems among young people. But supporters say that it will help create jobs and generate revenue for the state.

Washington is one of just a few states with a gambling age of 21. The majority have set the age at 18.

#  Washington Poised to Become the Next Nevada 

Politicians and pundits have been abuzz in recent weeks over the possibility that Washington state could become the next Nevada. The parallels are striking: both states are reliably Democratic, but have high levels of poverty and inequality. And in both states, an insurgent progressive movement has taken root, led by candidates like Socialist Bernie Sanders and Congressman Pramila Jayapal.

Washingtonians seem to be taking the possibility seriously. This week, Inslee for Governor announced that it had collected over 100,000 signatures in its effort to get a ballot initiative to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15/hour. The campaign is being chaired by Teresa Mosqueda, a city councilmember from Seattle and a key ally of Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid.

If Washington does indeed become the next Nevada, it will be a huge victory for the progressive movement. For years, progressives have been on the defensive, fighting to hold onto gains made in earlier decades. But with Sanders’ campaign and the rise of new progressive leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they are now on the offensive, pushing for bold new ideas like a $15/hour minimum wage and Medicare for All.

If Washington can turn its tide and elect progressive leaders like Jayapal and Mosqueda, it could provide a blueprint for progressives nationwide. The lesson would be clear: when we stand together and fight for our values, we can win big victories against corporate interests and the wealthy elite.

Gambling Age in WA State Could Soon be 18

Washington state lawmakers are considering a bill that would lower the gambling age from 21 to 18. The proposed measure is supported by tribal casinos, who argue that it would help them compete with neighboring states that have already relaxed their gambling age restrictions.

Supporters say that the change would help combat underage gambling, which is rampant in Washington state. They also note that young people can legally drink and smoke cigarettes at 18, so it only makes sense to allow them to gamble as well.

Critics of the proposal argue that lowering the gambling age would lead to more problem gambling among young people. They also point out that many casinos already offer gaming activities to minors, such as bingo and keno, which are much less risky than casino games like blackjack and poker.

The issue is currently being debated in the state legislature, and a final decision is expected later this year.

#  New Bill would Allow Gambling at 18 Years Old 

In a bipartisan effort, Senators Lindsey Graham (Republican-South Carolina) and Cory Booker (Democrat-New Jersey) have introduced the 'Raise the Age Act' to the Senate. The new bill would prohibit the sale of lottery tickets, as well as all forms of gambling, to people under the age of 21.

"Young people are too impressionable and often make poor decisions," Graham said in a statement. "This legislation will help protect them from predatory practices while also allowing states to decide if they want to increase the minimum age for purchasing lottery tickets and gambling." 

The move comes as several states, including New York and Connecticut, look to raise the minimum age for gambling from 18 to 21. It is not clear yet whether the Raise the Age Act will gain enough traction in Congress to be passed into law. 

Gambling can have serious negative consequences for young people. According to The National Council on Problem Gambling, "youth who gamble are more likely to experience family and social problems, including bankruptcy, physical abuse, and academic failure."

#  Washington May Lower the Legal Gambling Age

The state of Washington is the latest to consider a proposal that would lower the legal gambling age from 21 to 18. A bill was recently introduced in the state Senate that would make the change, and it has already gained some bipartisan support.

 Supporters of the proposal argue that it would help reduce gambling addiction rates by allowing younger adults access to gambling in a controlled environment. They also say that it would provide an additional revenue stream for the state government, as 18-year-olds would be able to gamble at casinos and other venues.

Opponents of the proposal argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates among young adults, and could also lead to other negative consequences such as increased crime rates and traffic accidents. They say that the state should focus on prevention and education efforts instead of promoting gambling.

The fate of the proposed bill is still uncertain, but it will likely face strong opposition from opponents who argue against lowering the legal gambling age.
