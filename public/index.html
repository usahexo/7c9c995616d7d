    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Dwarven-Gold-Slots-Finally-Legal-in-PA"><a href="#Dwarven-Gold-Slots-Finally-Legal-in-PA" class="headerlink" title="Dwarven Gold Slots Finally Legal in PA!"></a>Dwarven Gold Slots Finally Legal in PA!</h1><p>Pennsylvania has legalized the use of gold-only slots in casinos across the state, a move that is expected to increase tourism and revenue.</p>
<p>The new law is seen as a win for the dwarven community, who lobbied for the change. “Dwarves love gold,” said one advocate. “This will be a great opportunity for us to show our prowess at gambling.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it will create an unfair advantage for dwarven players, but supporters argue that the extra excitement will bring people from all over to try their luck.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no word on whether similar legislation will be passed in other states.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gambling-Ban-Lifted-in-PA"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Ban-Lifted-in-PA" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Ban Lifted in PA!"></a>Online Gambling Ban Lifted in PA!</h1><p>Pennsylvania’s online gambling ban has been lifted as of Tuesday, November 21st. This means that all forms of gambling are now available to Pennsylvanians, both in-person and online.</p>
<p>The move comes as a bit of a surprise, as Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf had previously spoken out against lifting the ban. In a statement released shortly after the ban was lifted, Wolf said that he plans to work with the state legislature to create “a set of regulations that protect Pennsylvanians and ensure that our casinos and racetracks are best positioned to compete.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly why Wolf has changed his stance on online gambling, but many believe that it has to do with the recent legalization of sports betting in Pennsylvania. With sports betting now available, Wolf may be worried that the state is losing out on potential tax revenue.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much reaction from the public about the change in policy. It will be interesting to see what happens when people start realizing that they can now gamble online legally in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that not all forms of gambling are available yet. The websites of PA’s casinos and racetracks have not yet been updated to reflect the change in policy. It’s possible that they will not be updated until after Thanksgiving.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Casinos-to-Offer-Online-Gambling-Soon"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Casinos-to-Offer-Online-Gambling-Soon" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Casinos to Offer Online Gambling Soon"></a>Pennsylvania Casinos to Offer Online Gambling Soon</h1><p>Pennsylvania casinos soon will offer online gambling, according to a statement Wednesday from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>The first step in the process is for the state’s 12 casinos to apply for interactive gaming licenses. The board has not announced when it will begin accepting those applications.</p>
<p>The move comes as the gaming industry deals with declining revenues from slot machines and table games.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Senate passed a bill in October that would have allowed online gambling, but it stalled in the House of Representatives. The measure would have allowed casinos to offer slots, blackjack, roulette and other games over the internet.</p>
<p>State Sen. Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, said he was confident that lawmakers would take up the issue again early in 2018.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, casino operators would be able to partner with companies outside of Pennsylvania to offer online gambling. Operators also could select one other entity to help them manage their interactive gaming operation. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Las Vegas Sands Corp., which owns The Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem, declined comment on Wednesday’s announcement.</p>

As of now, there are twelve casinos in the state, but only three of them have licenses to offer online gaming.</p>
<p>The first site to go live was Parx Casino on December 13th. The casino features 150 slot games and seventeen table games. There are also chat features and leaderboards to keep players engaged. All of the games on the site were developed by Bally Technologies.</p>
<p>Dwarven Gold, a new slot game from Bally, is one of the most popular titles on the site so far. The game is set in a Dwarven mine, and players can win up to 600x their bet per spin. Other popular games include Cash Spin and Lady Robin Hood.</p>
<p>Players can access Parx Casino from any computer or mobile device that has an Internet connection. They must be within the state of Pennsylvania to play, however.</p>
<p>The second site to go live was Mount Airy Casino on December 19th. The casino offers over 220 slot games and sixteen table games. There are also leaderboards and chat features available. Games offered include Starburst, Gonzo’s Quest, and Twin Spin Deluxe.</p>
<p>Players must be physically located in Pennsylvania in order to play at Mount Airy Casino. Like Parx Casino, the casino can be accessed from any device with an Internet connection.</p>
<p>The third site to go live was SugarHouse Casino on January 3rd. The casino offers over 270 slot games and seventeen table games. There are also chat features available for players. Games offered include Mega Fortune Dreams, Finn and the Swirly Spin, and Book of Dead. </p>
<p>Like Parx Casino, SugarHouse Casino can be accessed from any device with an Internet connection; however, players must be physically located in Pennsylvania in order to play at SugarHouse Casino</p>

        <h1 id="You-lose-all-your-cash-after-playing-just-10-minutes-in-the-casino"><a href="#You-lose-all-your-cash-after-playing-just-10-minutes-in-the-casino" class="headerlink" title="You lose all your cash after playing just 10 minutes in the casino!"></a>You lose all your cash after playing just 10 minutes in the casino!</h1><p>You’re all excited as you walk into the casino. You’ve just been paid and you can finally afford to try your luck at the tables. You take a seat and start playing. But after just 10 minutes, you lose everything! What happened?</p>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes people make when they go to a casino is thinking that they can win big in a short amount of time. They think that because they have some money, they can just sit down and start making it back right away. But this is not how casinos work!</p>
<p>Casinos are designed so that the house always wins in the long run. This means that even if you do manage to win in the short term, you will eventually lose all your money. So if you don’t want to risk losing everything, it’s best to stay away from the casino altogether!</p>
<h1 id="Another-person-has-stolen-all-of-your-chips-while-you-were-gambling"><a href="#Another-person-has-stolen-all-of-your-chips-while-you-were-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Another person has stolen all of your chips while you were gambling!"></a>Another person has stolen all of your chips while you were gambling!</h1><p>What do you do?</p>
<p>If someone has stolen all of your chips while you are gambling, you have a few options. One option is to call the police and let them handle the situation. Another option is to talk to the casino staff and see if they can help you get your chips back. If neither of those options works, you may also want to consider legal action.</p>
<h1 id="You-thought-you-could-double-your-money-but-instead-you-lost-everything"><a href="#You-thought-you-could-double-your-money-but-instead-you-lost-everything" class="headerlink" title="You thought you could double your money- but instead, you lost everything!"></a>You thought you could double your money- but instead, you lost everything!</h1><p>When you gamble, there is always a risk that you will lose everything you put in. This was the unfortunate experience of one gambler who thought he could double his money.</p>
<p>He had been told by a friend that if he put in $100, he could get it back plus an extra $100. So, he went ahead and did it- but quickly lost all of his money. In the end, he not only lost the initial $100 investment, but also the additional $100 that he had hoped to make.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about gambling, be aware that there is always the risk that you will lose everything you put in. Gambling should not be taken lightly- it is a serious decision that can have very negative consequences.</p>
<h1 id="The-house-always-wins-even-when-you’re-playing-blackjack"><a href="#The-house-always-wins-even-when-you’re-playing-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The house always wins- even when you’re playing blackjack!"></a>The house always wins- even when you’re playing blackjack!</h1><p>The first thing you need to understand about blackjack is that the house always has an edge. This is true regardless of how well you play the game. In fact, even if you’re playing with perfect strategy, the house still has a 1% edge over you.</p>
<p>This may seem like bad news, but it’s important to remember that the house edge applies to every player at the table- not just you. So, even if the casino is making money off of you in the short term, over time they will still lose money as more players join the table.</p>
<p>In addition to this, blackjack offers some of the best odds in casino games. This means that if you stick to basic strategy and avoid foolish mistakes, you can actually give yourself a decent chance of winning in the long run.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that you will win every time you play blackjack. However, by following a few simple guidelines and using a bit of common sense, you can minimize your losses and maximize your chances of walking away a winner!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-in-New-Vegas-can-be-a-real-gamble-sometimes-you-end-up-losing-everything-you-have"><a href="#Gambling-in-New-Vegas-can-be-a-real-gamble-sometimes-you-end-up-losing-everything-you-have" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in New Vegas can be a real gamble- sometimes you end up losing everything you have!"></a>Gambling in New Vegas can be a real gamble- sometimes you end up losing everything you have!</h1><p>Las Vegas is the city of sin, and gambling is one of its main attractions. If you want to gamble in New Vegas, you’re in for a real treat: there are all sorts of games to choose from, and the stakes can be high.</p>
<p>But while gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, it’s also risky- sometimes you can end up losing all your money in a heartbeat. So if you’re looking to gamble in New Vegas, be sure to do so responsibly, and know when to walk away from the table.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of different games you can gamble on in New Vegas: from blackjack and poker to roulette and craps. The key is to learn the rules of each game before playing for real money. That way, you’ll have a better idea of what you’re doing and won’t end up losing everything you’ve worked hard for.</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out, it might be a good idea to play some free games at first. This will help you get comfortable with the rules and betting process before risking any real money. You can also check out online casinos for free demos of each game.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when gambling in New Vegas is that the odds are not always in your favour. So don’t bet more than you can afford to lose, and be prepared to walk away from the table if things aren’t going your way. Gambling should be fun, not stressful!</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a thrilling experience and don’t mind risking some money, gambling in New Vegas is definitely for you! Just remember to play safe and have fun!</p>

Gambling addiction starts when someone gambles compulsively in order to try and escape from problems or feelings of distress. This can be very destructive to their life and can impact their physical, mental and social health.</p>
<p>There are many signs that can indicate someone has a gambling addiction. They may excessively gamble, have difficulty controlling their gambling, lie about their gambling or use gambling as a way to cope with problems. They may also experience negative consequences as a result of their gambling such as financial difficulties, relationship problems or mental health issues.</p>
<p>If you think you or someone you know may have a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many support services available for people with gambling addiction and its best to get help sooner rather than later.</p>
<h1 id="Scientists-Debate-How-Much-Choice-and-Luck-Factor-Into-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Scientists-Debate-How-Much-Choice-and-Luck-Factor-Into-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Scientists Debate How Much Choice and Luck Factor Into Gambling Addiction"></a>Scientists Debate How Much Choice and Luck Factor Into Gambling Addiction</h1><p>In recent years, the scientific study of gambling addiction has exploded. This is a good thing, as researchers have made great strides in understanding this complex and often misunderstood disorder. However, one question that remains unresolved is how much choice and luck factor into gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that gambling addiction is entirely due to choice, while others contend that luck has a significant role to play. The truth likely lies somewhere in the middle; while people with gambling addiction do make choices that contribute to their disorder, luck also plays a role.</p>
<p>One reason for the debate over the role of choice and luck in gambling addiction is that it is difficult to conduct research on the topic. While there are many studies on gambling addiction, most of them focus on people who are already addicted. It is difficult to determine whether these people became addicted due to their own choices or because of bad luck.</p>
<p>Another issue complicating the debate is that there is no consensus on what causes gambling addiction. Some experts believe that it is caused by a mix of genes and environment, while others claim that it is purely environmental. Again, it is difficult to determine how much choice and luck contribute to this disorder when its origins are still unknown.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, there are some clues available about how much choice and luck contribute to gambling addiction. For example, studies have shown that people who are more prone to risk- taking are more likely to develop gambling addiction. This suggests that choice does play a role in this disorder.</p>
<p>Additionally, research has shown that people with gambling addiction tend to make poor decisions when it comes to betting. For example, they may place bets when they have little chance of winning or they may bet more money than they can afford to lose. This suggests that poor decision- making is another consequence of having gambling addiction and that this disorder does lead to poorer choices.</p>
<p>While there is strong evidence that both choice and luck contribute to gambling addiction, it is important to note that these factors are not mutually exclusive. In other words, people with gambling addiction do make choices that contribute to their disorder, but these choices are often influenced by luck as well.</p>
<h1 id="Genetics-May-Play-Role-in-Whether-Gambling-Leads-to-Addiction"><a href="#Genetics-May-Play-Role-in-Whether-Gambling-Leads-to-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Genetics May Play Role in Whether Gambling Leads to Addiction"></a>Genetics May Play Role in Whether Gambling Leads to Addiction</h1><p>Gambling is a popular activity, but some people may be more likely to develop an addiction to it than others. A new study suggests that genetics may play a role in this.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal Biological Psychiatry, looked at the genetic makeup of more than 1,500 people who had a gambling problem and more than 2,000 people who did not have a gambling problem. The researchers found that certain gene variants were more common in the group with gambling problems than in the group without them.</p>
<p>The gene variants that were associated with a higher risk of gambling addiction are involved in the brain’s dopamine system. Dopamine is a chemical that plays a role in pleasure and reward, and it is thought to be involved in addiction.</p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that genetics may play a role in whether or not someone develops an addiction to gambling. More research is needed to confirm this link, but the findings could eventually lead to new ways to prevent and treat gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Brain-Imaging-Reveals-Differences-in-Gamblers-With-and-Without-Addictions"><a href="#Brain-Imaging-Reveals-Differences-in-Gamblers-With-and-Without-Addictions" class="headerlink" title="Brain Imaging Reveals Differences in Gamblers With and Without Addictions"></a>Brain Imaging Reveals Differences in Gamblers With and Without Addictions</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a mental disorder that is characterized by excessive and compulsive gambling. The disorder can have a serious impact on someone’s life, including their finances, work, relationships, and mental health.</p>
<p>Despite being a well-known problem, gambling addiction remains largely mysterious. In fact, the underlying brain mechanisms that contribute to the development of this disorder are still not fully understood.</p>
<p>To help shed light on this issue, a team of researchers recently conducted a study using brain imaging technology. The study aimed to compare the brains of people with gambling addictions to those without addictions.</p>
<p>The results of the study were published in the journal Addiction Biology.</p>
<p>The study involved 40 individuals who were diagnosed with gambling addiction and 40 individuals who did not have an addiction. The participants were all male and ranged in age from 18 to 50 years old.</p>
<p>Each participant underwent brain imaging scans using two different techniques: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).</p>
<p>The results of the fMRI scans showed that there were differences in the brains of individuals with and without gambling addictions. Specifically, the scans revealed increased activation in certain areas of the brain in individuals with addictions. These areas included the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula.</p>
<p>The DTI scans also showed differences between the two groups of participants. The scans revealed that individuals with gambling addictions had lower levels of white matter integrity in specific areas of the brain, including the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate cortex.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Recognize-the-Signs-of-a-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#How-to-Recognize-the-Signs-of-a-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="How to Recognize the Signs of a Gambling Addiction"></a>How to Recognize the Signs of a Gambling Addiction</h1><p>While gambling addiction is not technically recognized as a mental disorder, it is still a problem that many people suffer from. The signs of a gambling addiction can be difficult to spot, but if you are aware of what to look for, you can get help for the person suffering before the problem gets too out of control.</p>
<p>The first sign that someone may have a gambling addiction is that they start to gamble more and more often. They may also start to take bigger risks when gambling, in an attempt to win back money they have lost or to get the rush of winning that they are looking for. When someone is addicted to gambling, their life starts to revolve around gambling and they will do whatever it takes to keep betting. This can include borrowing money from others, stealing money, or even selling possessions in order to get more money to gamble with.</p>
<p>In addition to increased gambling habits, another sign of a gambling addiction is secrecy and isolation. Gambling addicts will often try to hide their behavior from friends and family members, and they may withdraw from social activities altogether in order to spend more time gambling. They may also start making up excuses as to why they cannot go out or why they need money, and these excuses may seem suspicious or illogical.</p>
<p>If you think someone you know may be suffering from a gambling addiction, there are ways that you can help. The most important thing is to talk openly about the problem and offer your support. You can also recommend professional help if necessary. There are many different treatment options available for gambling addicts, and with the right support, they can overcome their addiction and rebuild their life.</p>

        <h1 id="New-research-reveals-a-shocking-connection-between-hoarding-and-gambling"><a href="#New-research-reveals-a-shocking-connection-between-hoarding-and-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New research reveals a shocking connection between hoarding and gambling!"></a>New research reveals a shocking connection between hoarding and gambling!</h1><p>The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Toronto, found that hoarders and problem gamblers are more likely to share similar brain activity patterns.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that there may be a common neurocircuitry underlying both hoarding and gambling behavior,” said lead researcher Dr. Juha Koski.</p>
<p>The study involved scanning the brains of 83 participants – 33 hoarders, 33 problem gamblers, and 17 healthy control subjects.</p>
<p>The results showed that both hoarders and problem gamblers had lower activity in the frontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and inhibition. They also had increased activity in the striatum, which is associated with reward-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>“Hoarding and gambling may both be driven by a need for excitement and a decreased ability to inhibit impulsive behavior,” said Koski.</p>
<p>These findings could help to improve our understanding of these disorders and could lead to the development of new treatments.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-that-those-who-gamble-are-more-likely-to-hoard-possessions"><a href="#Study-finds-that-those-who-gamble-are-more-likely-to-hoard-possessions" class="headerlink" title="Study finds that those who gamble are more likely to hoard possessions!"></a>Study finds that those who gamble are more likely to hoard possessions!</h1><p>A recent study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Bonn has found that people who gamble are more likely to hoard possessions. The study, which is set to be published in the journal “Personality and Individual Differences”, surveyed 585 people about their gambling habits and hoarding behaviour.</p>
<p>The results showed that those who gamble are more likely to hoard possessions, regardless of whether they win or lose money. This was especially true for men, who were almost three times as likely to hoard possessions if they gambled than those who didn’t gamble. Women didn’t show such a significant difference.</p>
<p>So why do people hoard possessions?</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Lukas Klucken, said that it’s possible that people who gamble may hoard possessions as a way to increase their chances of winning. “They might think that if they have more things, they will be luckier and therefore make more money,” he said.</p>
<p>However, he added that it’s also possible that the link between gambling and hoarding is due to other factors, such as impulsiveness or perfectionism. More research is needed to determine the precise reasons behind the link between gambling and hoarding.</p>
<p>The findings of this study are interesting, and could provide valuable insight into why some people hoard possessions. It’s possible that this research could help researchers develop interventions for hoarding behaviour.</p>
<h1 id="Hoarders-may-have-higher-rates-of-gambling-involvement"><a href="#Hoarders-may-have-higher-rates-of-gambling-involvement" class="headerlink" title="Hoarders may have higher rates of gambling involvement!"></a>Hoarders may have higher rates of gambling involvement!</h1><p>According to a study published in the journal “Addictive Behaviors,” hoarders may have higher rates of gambling involvement. The study was conducted with 96 participants, 38 of whom were classified as hoarders and 58 who were not.</p>
<p>Hoarding is characterized by excessive collecting of items, which results in significant clutter and impairment in functioning. Gambling is a behavior characterized by repeated engagement in wagering activities, despite negative consequences.</p>
<p>The study found that hoarders were more likely to report lifetime gambling involvement (72% vs. 41%), as well as problem gambling (41% vs. 15%). They were also more likely to report current gambling involvement (25% vs. 10%) and more severe problems with gambling (4.4 vs 2.5 on a 7-point scale).</p>
<p>These findings suggest that there may be a link between hoarding and gambling, and further research is needed to understand this relationship better. If you or someone you know suffers from hoarding, it may be important to also assess for problem gambling behaviors, and seek treatment if necessary.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-and-hoarding-may-share-similar-psychological-root-causes"><a href="#Gambling-and-hoarding-may-share-similar-psychological-root-causes" class="headerlink" title="Gambling and hoarding may share similar psychological root causes!"></a>Gambling and hoarding may share similar psychological root causes!</h1><p>A recent study has shown that there may be some common psychological root causes of both gambling and hoarding. The study, undertaken by a team of researchers at the University of Amsterdam, found that both activities may be motivated by a desire to maintain control over one’s environment.</p>
<p>Participants in the study were asked to complete a questionnaire measuring their motivations for gambling and hoarding. The results showed that both activities were associated with a desire to feel in control of one’s environment. Participants who scored higher on the control scale were more likely to gamble or hoard.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that interventions aimed at helping people who gamble or hoard could benefit from focusing on increasing feelings of control. This could involve therapies that help people learn how to better manage their environment, as well as stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>The study is published in the journal Addictive Behaviors.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-link-between-hoarding-and-gambling"><a href="#What-is-the-link-between-hoarding-and-gambling" class="headerlink" title="What is the link between hoarding and gambling?"></a>What is the link between hoarding and gambling?</h1><p>Hoarding and gambling are two addictive behaviors that can have a serious impact on a person’s life. While the two behaviors may seem unrelated, there is a link between hoarding and gambling.</p>
<p>People who hoard often have a mental disorder known as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder is characterized by intrusive thoughts and impulses that lead to repetitive behaviors. People with OCD are often very organized and perfectionistic, which can lead to hoarding.</p>
<p>Hoarding can be very costly and time-consuming. People with this disorder tend to accumulate large amounts of possessions, which they often can’t use or don’t need. As a result, they may not have enough space for living or working, and their home may be cluttered and unsanitary.</p>
<p>Gambling can also be very costly and time-consuming. Like hoarders, people with a gambling addiction can’t stop themselves from gambling, even when it causes negative consequences in their lives. Gambling can lead to financial problems, job loss, and family conflict.</p>
<p>There is no one cause of hoarding or gambling addiction. However, both disorders may be linked to emotional problems such as low self-esteem or depression. Treatment for hoarding and gambling addiction typically includes counseling and behavioral therapies.</p>

        <h1 id="Washington-to-Lower-the-Legal-Gambling-Age-to-18"><a href="#Washington-to-Lower-the-Legal-Gambling-Age-to-18" class="headerlink" title="Washington to Lower the Legal Gambling Age to 18"></a>Washington to Lower the Legal Gambling Age to 18</h1><p> After a long and heated debate, the Washington state Senate has approved a bill that would allow people as young as 18 to gamble in the state’s casinos and card rooms.</p>
<p>The bill, which now goes to the House for approval, was introduced by Republican Senator Mike Padden of Spokane Valley. It passed on a 25-22 vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to increased addiction and social problems among young people. But supporters say that it will help create jobs and generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Washington is one of just a few states with a gambling age of 21. The majority have set the age at 18.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Poised-to-Become-the-Next-Nevada"><a href="#Washington-Poised-to-Become-the-Next-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="Washington Poised to Become the Next Nevada"></a>Washington Poised to Become the Next Nevada</h1><p>Politicians and pundits have been abuzz in recent weeks over the possibility that Washington state could become the next Nevada. The parallels are striking: both states are reliably Democratic, but have high levels of poverty and inequality. And in both states, an insurgent progressive movement has taken root, led by candidates like Socialist Bernie Sanders and Congressman Pramila Jayapal.</p>
<p>Washingtonians seem to be taking the possibility seriously. This week, Inslee for Governor announced that it had collected over 100,000 signatures in its effort to get a ballot initiative to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15&#x2F;hour. The campaign is being chaired by Teresa Mosqueda, a city councilmember from Seattle and a key ally of Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid.</p>
<p>If Washington does indeed become the next Nevada, it will be a huge victory for the progressive movement. For years, progressives have been on the defensive, fighting to hold onto gains made in earlier decades. But with Sanders’ campaign and the rise of new progressive leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they are now on the offensive, pushing for bold new ideas like a $15&#x2F;hour minimum wage and Medicare for All.</p>
<p>If Washington can turn its tide and elect progressive leaders like Jayapal and Mosqueda, it could provide a blueprint for progressives nationwide. The lesson would be clear: when we stand together and fight for our values, we can win big victories against corporate interests and the wealthy elite.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Age-in-WA-State-Could-Soon-be-18"><a href="#Gambling-Age-in-WA-State-Could-Soon-be-18" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Age in WA State Could Soon be 18"></a>Gambling Age in WA State Could Soon be 18</h1><p>Gambling Age in WA State Could Soon be 18</p>
<p>Washington state lawmakers are considering a bill that would lower the gambling age from 21 to 18. The proposed measure is supported by tribal casinos, who argue that it would help them compete with neighboring states that have already relaxed their gambling age restrictions.</p>
<p>Supporters say that the change would help combat underage gambling, which is rampant in Washington state. They also note that young people can legally drink and smoke cigarettes at 18, so it only makes sense to allow them to gamble as well.</p>
<p>Critics of the proposal argue that lowering the gambling age would lead to more problem gambling among young people. They also point out that many casinos already offer gaming activities to minors, such as bingo and keno, which are much less risky than casino games like blackjack and poker.</p>
<p>The issue is currently being debated in the state legislature, and a final decision is expected later this year.</p>
<h1 id="New-Bill-would-Allow-Gambling-at-18-Years-Old"><a href="#New-Bill-would-Allow-Gambling-at-18-Years-Old" class="headerlink" title="New Bill would Allow Gambling at 18 Years Old"></a>New Bill would Allow Gambling at 18 Years Old</h1><p>In a bipartisan effort, Senators Lindsey Graham (Republican-South Carolina) and Cory Booker (Democrat-New Jersey) have introduced the ‘Raise the Age Act’ to the Senate. The new bill would prohibit the sale of lottery tickets, as well as all forms of gambling, to people under the age of 21.</p>
<p>“Young people are too impressionable and often make poor decisions,” Graham said in a statement. “This legislation will help protect them from predatory practices while also allowing states to decide if they want to increase the minimum age for purchasing lottery tickets and gambling.” </p>
<p>The move comes as several states, including New York and Connecticut, look to raise the minimum age for gambling from 18 to 21. It is not clear yet whether the Raise the Age Act will gain enough traction in Congress to be passed into law. </p>
<p>Gambling can have serious negative consequences for young people. According to The National Council on Problem Gambling, “youth who gamble are more likely to experience family and social problems, including bankruptcy, physical abuse, and academic failure.”</p>
<h1 id="Washington-May-Lower-the-Legal-Gambling-Age"><a href="#Washington-May-Lower-the-Legal-Gambling-Age" class="headerlink" title="Washington May Lower the Legal Gambling Age"></a>Washington May Lower the Legal Gambling Age</h1><p>The state of Washington is the latest to consider a proposal that would lower the legal gambling age from 21 to 18. A bill was recently introduced in the state Senate that would make the change, and it has already gained some bipartisan support.</p>
<p> Supporters of the proposal argue that it would help reduce gambling addiction rates by allowing younger adults access to gambling in a controlled environment. They also say that it would provide an additional revenue stream for the state government, as 18-year-olds would be able to gamble at casinos and other venues.</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposal argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates among young adults, and could also lead to other negative consequences such as increased crime rates and traffic accidents. They say that the state should focus on prevention and education efforts instead of promoting gambling.</p>
<p>The fate of the proposed bill is still uncertain, but it will likely face strong opposition from opponents who argue against lowering the legal gambling age.</p>

        <h1 id="How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return"><a href="#How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-and-Losses-on-Your-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="How to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses on Your Tax Return"></a>How to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses on Your Tax Return</h1><p>In the United States, taxpayers are required to report their gambling winnings and losses on their tax returns. This is done in order to ensure that the government knows how much tax revenue it can expect to receive from gambling activities.</p>
<p>There are a few things that you need to know in order to report your gambling winnings and losses correctly. First of all, you need to know what constitutes as gambling income. Gambling income includes not only winnings from traditional casino games like slot machines and blackjack, but also winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and other gambling activities.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be claimed as a deduction on your tax return. In order to claim your losses, you need to keep track of all of your gambling transactions throughout the year. This includes both the amount of money that you won and lost, as well as the date and location of each transaction.</p>
<p>If you itemize your deductions on your tax return, then you can claim your gambling losses as a deduction on Schedule A. However, if you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing, then you cannot claim your gambling losses.</p>
<p>It is important to note that you cannot deduct more than your total gambling income for the year. So if you had $1,000 in gambling income for the year, then you can only deduct up to $1,000 in losses. Any excess losses can be carried over to future years.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that only individuals who report their income on a net basis can claim their gambling losses as a deduction. Business owners who report their income on a gross basis cannot claim their gambling losses.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Pay-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-to-Pay-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How to Pay Taxes on Gambling Winnings"></a>How to Pay Taxes on Gambling Winnings</h1><p>If you’ve ever won money while gambling, whether it’s from a casino, lottery or another form of gambling, you may be wondering how to pay taxes on your winnings. Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Gambling Income vs. Gambling Losses</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand is the difference between gambling income and gambling losses. Gambling income is the amount of money you earn from gambling activities, while gambling losses are the amount of money you lose from gambling activities. Both are reported on your tax return, but they’re treated differently.</p>
<p>Gambling income is considered taxable income, while gambling losses are considered deductible expenses. This means that you can subtract your gambling losses from your gambling income to determine your net gambling income. Your net gambling income is the amount of money that’s subject to taxation.</p>
<p>Reporting Gambling Winnings and Losses</p>
<p>To report your gambling winnings and losses, you’ll need to complete Form 1040, Schedule A. This form is used to report itemized deductions. To complete it, simply list your total gambling income on line 21 and your total gambling losses on line 28. Then, subtract the losses from the income to determine your net gambling income. This amount goes on line 22 of Schedule A.</p>
<p>You may also be able to claim a deduction for your state and local taxes paid on your winnings. To do this, complete Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return and enter the amount of state and local taxes paid on Line 6d of that form. Attach a copy of Form 1040 or 1040A (not Form 1040EZ) to your amended return. Note that not all states allow taxpayers to claim a deduction for state and local taxes paid on their winnings. Consult with a tax professional in your state for more information.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-the-Tax-Implications-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#What-Are-the-Tax-Implications-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Tax Implications for Gambling Winnings?"></a>What Are the Tax Implications for Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>Gambling winnings are considered taxable income by the IRS. This means that you are required to report any winnings on your tax return and pay taxes on the amount.</p>
<p>The amount of tax you owe on gambling winnings depends on your income level and filing status. For most people, gambling income is taxed at the same rate as regular income. However, there are a few exceptions.</p>
<p>If you have gambling winnings of $5,000 or more in a year, you will be required to file Form 1040 and report the income on line 21. If you have other gambling-related expenses, such as losses or travel costs, you can deduct those expenses from your winnings on line 27. This will reduce your taxable income and may save you some money on taxes.</p>
<p>If you have gambling winnings of more than $1,200 but less than $5,000, you will be required to file Form 1040A and report the income on line 7. You cannot deduct any gambling-related expenses if you file Form 1040A.</p>
<p>If you have gambling winnings of $600 or more but less than $1,200, you will be required to file Form 1040EZ and report the income on line 1. You cannot deduct any gambling-related expenses if you file Form 1040EZ.</p>
<p>The rules for reporting gambling losses are a bit different. You can only deduct losses if they exceed your total winnings for the year. In other words, if you had $1,000 in gambling wins and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 worth of losses from your taxable income.</p>
<p>You can claim your losses either on Schedule A (if you itemize deductions) or on Line 28 of Form 1040. Be sure to keep careful records of all your gambling transactions so that you can accurately report your losses and avoid any penalties from the IRS.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable-in-Canada"><a href="#Are-Gambling-Winnings-Taxable-in-Canada" class="headerlink" title="Are Gambling Winnings Taxable in Canada?"></a>Are Gambling Winnings Taxable in Canada?</h1><p>When it comes to taxation, there are a lot of things that people in Canada don’t know about. For example, are gambling winnings taxable in Canada? The answer is yes, they are.</p>
<p>Gambling winnings are considered to be income and, as such, they are subject to tax. This applies to both individuals and businesses. In fact, the Canadian government takes gambling taxes very seriously and has levied significant fines against those who have failed to pay them.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, lottery winnings are not taxable in Canada. However, most other types of gambling winnings are. This includes wins from casinos, sports betting, and online poker sites.</p>
<p>The amount of tax that you will have to pay on your gambling winnings depends on how much you earn in total over the course of the year. The tax rates for different income levels are as follows:</p>
<p>Up to $45,225: 15%</p>
<p>$45,226 to $90,450: 22%</p>
<p>$90,451 to $140,650: 26%</p>
<p>$140,651 or more: 29%</p>
<p>As you can see, the higher your income level is, the higher the tax rate will be. However, even if your gambling winnings only put you into the lowest income bracket, you will still have to pay taxes on them.</p>
<h1 id="Do-I-Have-to-Pay-Taxes-on-My-Lottery-Winnings"><a href="#Do-I-Have-to-Pay-Taxes-on-My-Lottery-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Do I Have to Pay Taxes on My Lottery Winnings?"></a>Do I Have to Pay Taxes on My Lottery Winnings?</h1><p>As with any other form of income, you may have to pay taxes on lottery winnings. The amount you have to pay will depend on how much you win and your tax bracket.</p>
<p>For example, if you win a $600 lottery prize, you will likely have to pay about $100 in taxes. This is because the prize is considered taxable income and is taxed at your marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>However, if you win a jackpot worth millions of dollars, the taxes you have to pay will be much higher. In fact, the government may take almost half of your winnings in taxes. So, it’s important to know how much you can expect to pay before you start dreaming about what you’ll do with your new fortune.</p>
<p>If you do have to pay taxes on your lottery winnings, there are a few ways to reduce the amount you owe. One way is to report your winnings as income on your tax return. This will ensure that you receive the appropriate tax break for gambling losses.</p>
<p>You can also claim the standard deduction on your return, which could lower your taxable income. And if you itemize your deductions, you may be able to deduct some of your gambling losses as well.</p>
<p>Finally, if you don’t want to wait until tax season to get your money’s worth, there are a few states that offer tax deductions for lottery prizes. So, be sure to check with your state’s department of revenue to see if this is an option for you.</p>

<p>Hard Rock International is set to open the doors of its new casino resort on June 28, putting an end to the city’s monopoly on gambling. Atlantic City has long been the only place in New Jersey where you could gamble, but that is changing as Pennsylvania and Delaware both offer casinos as well.</p>
<p>The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Atlantic City is located on the Boardwalk and will feature 2,200 slot machines, 120 table games, and a 200-seat rock ‘n’ roll showroom. The hotel has 797 rooms and suites.</p>
<p>“We are excited to open our doors and welcome guests starting on June 28,” said Jim Allen, CEO of Hard Rock International. “This property represents a completely new era and vision for Hard Rock in the Northeast and sets us up for continued success in this important market.”</p>
<p>The opening of the Hard Rock comes at a time when Atlantic City is seeing a resurgence in popularity. The city’s motto is now “Do AC” as opposed to “Just Say No”, and there are new hotels and restaurants popping up all over town.</p>
<p>Some experts are predicting that the arrival of Hard Rock will cause a sharp decline in business for the city’s other casino resorts. But others believe that there is enough business to go around for everyone.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-player-dominates-at-new-Atlantic-City-casino"><a href="#Poker-player-dominates-at-new-Atlantic-City-casino" class="headerlink" title="Poker player dominates at new Atlantic City casino"></a>Poker player dominates at new Atlantic City casino</h1><p>When Atlantic City’s newest casino, the Golden Nugget, opened its doors in late August, one of the first people to test his luck at the slot machines and tables was professional poker player Phil Ivey.</p>
<p>Ivey didn’t waste any time in proving that he is one of the best players in the business: by the end of his first day at the casino, he had already won over $800,000.</p>
<p>“This place is amazing,” said Ivey after his big win. “There are so many games to choose from and so much money to be made. I can’t wait to come back and do even better.”</p>
<p>The Golden Nugget is now home to one of the largest poker rooms on the East Coast, and Ivey plans to make regular appearances there in order to take advantage of the large pots and juicy side bets on offer.</p>
<p>Atlantic City has been without a top-notch poker room since Revel Casino closed down in 2014, so Ivey’s arrival is definitely good news for fans of the game. With Ivey in town, they can expect some exciting high-stakes matchups between some of the best players in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-casino-beats-Las-Vegas-in-poker-player-earnings"><a href="#Atlantic-City-casino-beats-Las-Vegas-in-poker-player-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City casino beats Las Vegas in poker player earnings"></a>Atlantic City casino beats Las Vegas in poker player earnings</h1><p>The city of Las Vegas has long been known as the gambling capital of the world. However, a recent study by The Street shows that Atlantic City casinos are now earning more from poker players than casinos in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The Street’s analysts used information from Poker Industry PRO to determine that in 2017, Atlantic City casinos earned $151 million from poker, while Las Vegas casinos only earned $141 million. This is the first time that Atlantic City has beaten Las Vegas in this category.</p>
<p>What could be causing this shift? One possible explanation is that Atlantic City’s casinos have been making a concerted effort to attract poker players in recent years. In addition to offering a wide variety of games and tournaments, Atlantic City casinos have also been investing in new technology that allows players to compete against each other online.</p>
<p>Las Vegas casinos may soon need to start paying attention to their competitors in the east coast if they want to stay on top. In recent years, Las Vegas has been dealt some major blows as casino revenues have steadily declined. The city is now looking for new ways to bring in money, and poker may not be enough.</p>
<h1 id="Second-casino-in-the-world-for-poker-player-opens-in-Atlantic-City"><a href="#Second-casino-in-the-world-for-poker-player-opens-in-Atlantic-City" class="headerlink" title="Second casino in the world for poker player opens in Atlantic City"></a>Second casino in the world for poker player opens in Atlantic City</h1><p>Atlantic City, New Jersey is now the home to two casinos specifically catering to poker players. The Borgata, which has been a major player in the Atlantic City casino market since 2003, opened its Poker Lounge in January of this year. Admission to the lounge is free for hotel guests and $60 for those not staying at the Borgata.</p>
<p>The lounge offers 38 tables and a variety of cash games and tournaments. Tournaments range in buy-in from $27 to $2,000 and offer prizes up to $100,000. The Poker Lounge also offers a VIP program that gives members access to special tournaments, concierge service, and other perks.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Resorts Casino Hotel opened its own poker room. The Resorts Casino Hotel was originally built as a bingo hall in 1978 but has since been remodeled into a full-fledged casino. The new poker room has 12 tables and offers both cash games and tournaments. Tournament buy-ins range from $20 to $530 and offer prizes up to $25,000.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s resurgence as a poker destination comes as no surprise to many experts. In 2013, New Jersey became the third state in the United States (after Nevada and Delaware) to legalize online poker. This has allowed New Jersey poker players to compete against each other on a wide variety of online sites.</p>
<p>The opening of the Borgata’s Poker Lounge and the Resorts Casino Hotel’s poker room comes at an opportune time for Atlantic City as it faces increasing competition from casino resorts in Pennsylvaniaand New York.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-player-cashes-in-on-new-Atlantic-City-casino"><a href="#Poker-player-cashes-in-on-new-Atlantic-City-casino" class="headerlink" title="Poker player cashes in on new Atlantic City casino"></a>Poker player cashes in on new Atlantic City casino</h1><p>Atlantic City’s newest casino is already paying off for one lucky poker player.</p>
<p>The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, recently won a whopping $271,000 at the Borgata Casino.</p>
<p>The big win came after just two hours of playing poker at the new casino.</p>
<p>“I’m still in shock,” the player said in a statement released by the Borgata. “I can’t believe this actually happened.”</p>
<p>This victory is just the latest in a long line of successes for the player, who has been playing professionally for six years.</p>
<p>In fact, the winnings from this one session are already enough to cover all of the player’s losses from the past year.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited to see what I can do with this money,” the player said. “I may even take a vacation.”</p>
<p>The Borgata Casino is one of Atlantic City’s newer casinos, having opened its doors in 2003. It is owned by MGM Mirage and features more than 2,000 slot machines and 120 table games.</p>

        <h1 id="Study-Shows-Pennsylvania-Casinos-May-Be-Cheating-Players"><a href="#Study-Shows-Pennsylvania-Casinos-May-Be-Cheating-Players" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Pennsylvania Casinos May Be Cheating Players"></a>Study Shows Pennsylvania Casinos May Be Cheating Players</h1><p>A recent study conducted by two professors at the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that casinos in Pennsylvania may be cheating players. The study, which will be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Gambling Studies, looked at nearly 1.5 million betting patterns from 2014 to 2016 at 12 casinos in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The study found that the casinos were more likely to win when players bet on blackjack and roulette. In fact, the casinos won more than they should have when players bet on blackjack, and they won almost twice as much as they should have when players bet on roulette.</p>
<p>“The fact that the house edge was increased for blackjack and roulette suggests that casino personnel may be manipulating the games in favor of the house,” said study co-author Dr. Michael Shafer.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that concerns have been raised about cheating at Pennsylvania casinos. In 2016, a group of gamblers filed a lawsuit against three casinos in Pennsylvania, claiming that the casinos were using illegal methods to tilt the odds in their favor.</p>
<p>Casino officials deny any wrongdoing, and say that the findings of the UMass Amherst study are flawed. They maintain that the House Edge is always in favor of the casino, and that no manipulation is taking place.</p>
<p>Regardless of who is right and who is wrong, this study is sure to cause concerns among players who gamble at Pennsylvania casinos. If you’re one of those players, it might be a good idea to keep an eye on your betting patterns and see if you start losing more often than you should be.</p>
<h1 id="State’s-Gaming-Control-Board-Launches-Investigation-Into-Alleged-Cheating"><a href="#State’s-Gaming-Control-Board-Launches-Investigation-Into-Alleged-Cheating" class="headerlink" title="State’s Gaming Control Board Launches Investigation Into Alleged Cheating"></a>State’s Gaming Control Board Launches Investigation Into Alleged Cheating</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board has launched an investigation into allegations of cheating at the state’s largest casino.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Board, the investigation was launched after several employees of the casino filed a complaint alleging that members of a high-stakes poker game had been cheating.</p>
<p>The Board did not release any details about the alleged cheating, but said that it was “significant enough” to warrant an investigation.</p>
<p>“The Nevada Gaming Control Board takes any allegation of cheating seriously,” said Board Chairman A.G. Burnett in a statement. “We are committed to ensuring the integrity of our gaming industry and will conduct a full and thorough investigation into these allegations.”</p>
<p>The casino declined to comment on the allegations, but said that it was cooperating fully with the Board’s investigation.</p>
<h1 id="Officials-Suspect-Insider-Cheating-at-Some-Pennsylvania-Casinos"><a href="#Officials-Suspect-Insider-Cheating-at-Some-Pennsylvania-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Officials Suspect Insider Cheating at Some Pennsylvania Casinos"></a>Officials Suspect Insider Cheating at Some Pennsylvania Casinos</h1><p>Pennsylvania casino regulators believe that cheating may be taking place at some casinos in the state. The officials have not released the names of the casinos or exactly how the cheating is taking place, but they believe that it is happening largely due to people with inside information.</p>
<p>One theory is that employees of the casinos are tipping off friends or family members about which slot machines are likely to pay out and then those people are playing those machines and winning large sums of money. Another possibility is that someone is getting access to the casino’s computer systems and manipulating the odds in their favor.</p>
<p>Regulators say that they have been investigating this issue for some time now and that they have identified several potential instances of cheating. However, they have not yet been able to confirm any allegations. In the meantime, they are urging casino operators to increase their security measures and be on the lookout for any suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many people, as Pennsylvania casinos are typically considered to be very secure. In fact, most of the cheating that does take place in casinos tends to happen in offshore establishments where security is not as tight.</p>
<p>Regulators believe that this development could impact the state’s casino industry, as players may start to become more wary about gambling at Pennsylvania casinos. This could result in a decline in revenue for these establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-at-Alleged-Cheating-Casino-Fired-After-Being-Caught"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-at-Alleged-Cheating-Casino-Fired-After-Being-Caught" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer at Alleged Cheating Casino Fired After Being Caught"></a>Blackjack Dealer at Alleged Cheating Casino Fired After Being Caught</h1><p>The blackjack dealer at an alleged cheating casino has been fired after being caught. Management at the casino say that they have a zero tolerance policy for cheating and that the dealer will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>The casino has refused to name the dealer, but say that they are a woman in her mid-thirties. She is said to have been caught on camera dealing cards from the bottom of the deck. This is a well known cheating technique that can give players an advantage by allowing them to see which cards are coming next.</p>
<p>The dealer was caught during a routine inspection by management and was immediately fired. She is now facing criminal charges for cheating and could spend time in prison if found guilty.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that allegations of cheating have been made against this casino. In fact, it has been long rumoured that the casino is rigged in favour of the house. This latest incident is likely to only add to those rumours.</p>
<p>Management at the casino have denied all allegations of cheating and insist that their games are fair and honest. However, many players will now be questioning whether or not they can trust this establishment.</p>

<p>The audit focused on the use of devices such as card counting tools and ‘followers’ who observe game play and signal potential winning bets to players.</p>
<p>It identified 34 instances of suspected cheating at seven casinos over a two-year period. In each case, casino security had already identified the players involved and taken action, including barring them from the casino.</p>
<p>The audit makes a series of recommendations to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), including:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening procedures to identify and investigate suspected cheating</li>
<li>providing more training to casino staff on how to identify cheating</li>
<li>developing guidelines for when and how casino security should intervene.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a statement, PGCB said it “will give serious consideration” to the recommendations. It also noted that the board has “a robust compliance program in place that includes measures specifically designed to prevent and detect cheating”.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s casino industry is worth around $2.5 billion annually, with 10 casinos currently operating in the state.</p>
