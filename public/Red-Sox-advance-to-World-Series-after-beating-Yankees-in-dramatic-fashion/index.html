<p>The game went into extra innings, with the Red Sox trailing 4-3. Xander Bogaerts then hit a huge three-run homer in the top of the 10th inning, giving Boston a 6-4 lead.</p>
<p>Craig Kimbrel then came in to close out the game, and got Gary Sanchez to ground out to end it.</p>
<p>The Red Sox will now face either the Los Angeles Dodgers or Milwaukee Brewers in the World Series.</p>
<h1 id="David-Price-pitches-masterful-game-as-Red-Sox-take-commanding-3-1-lead-over-Yankees"><a href="#David-Price-pitches-masterful-game-as-Red-Sox-take-commanding-3-1-lead-over-Yankees" class="headerlink" title="David Price pitches masterful game as Red Sox take commanding 3-1 lead over Yankees"></a>David Price pitches masterful game as Red Sox take commanding 3-1 lead over Yankees</h1><p>The Red Sox were looking to take a commanding 3-1 lead over the Yankees in the American League Divisional Series and that is exactly what David Price did on Sunday night. The left-hander pitched a dominating game, allowing just two hits over eight innings of work while striking out nine batters.</p>
<p>The Red Sox offense also came through, scoring four runs off of Yankees starter Luis Severino. Xander Bogaerts led the way with two hits and three RBIs, including a two-run home run in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>With the win, the Red Sox now have a chance to close out the series on Tuesday night at Fenway Park. Brian Johnson will get the start for Boston, while Jaime Garcia will take the mound for New York.</p>
<h1 id="Xander-Bogaerts-delivers-walk-off-hit-as-Boston-Red-Sox-complete-sweep-of-Yankees"><a href="#Xander-Bogaerts-delivers-walk-off-hit-as-Boston-Red-Sox-complete-sweep-of-Yankees" class="headerlink" title="Xander Bogaerts delivers walk-off hit as Boston Red Sox complete sweep of Yankees"></a>Xander Bogaerts delivers walk-off hit as Boston Red Sox complete sweep of Yankees</h1><p>Xander Bogaerts hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the 10th inning as the Boston Red Sox completed a three-game sweep of the New York Yankees with a 4-3 win on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Red Sox (77-34) have now won seven straight games and 11 of their last 12, while the Yankees (56-49) have lost six of their last eight.</p>
<p>Bogaerts entered the game as a pinch hitter in the bottom of the ninth inning and delivered when it mattered most, driving in J.D. Martinez with the winning run.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable,” Boston manager Alex Cora said of Bogaerts’ heroics. “He’s been doing it all year for us.”</p>
<p>Rafael Devers also went deep for Boston, while Craig Kimbrel pitched a perfect 10th inning to earn his 35th save of the season.</p>
<p>Yankees starter J.A. Happ was outstanding, allowing just two runs on five hits over 8 1&#x2F;3 innings, but was denied his 14th win of the season. Luis Severino gave up two runs in 6 1&#x2F;3 innings for New York.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Yankees-eliminated-from-postseason-contention-after-losing-to-Boston-Red-Sox"><a href="#New-York-Yankees-eliminated-from-postseason-contention-after-losing-to-Boston-Red-Sox" class="headerlink" title="New York Yankees eliminated from postseason contention after losing to Boston Red Sox"></a>New York Yankees eliminated from postseason contention after losing to Boston Red Sox</h1><p>The New York Yankees were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention on Sunday night, following their loss to the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>The Yankees had been in a tight race for the second Wild Card spot in the American League, but they ultimately fell short, finishing two games behind the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>Boston’s win over New York was not without controversy, as Red Sox outfielder Mookie Betts was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the bottom of the sixth inning,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> allowing all three runners to score.</p>
<p>Yankees manager Aaron Boone was ejected from the game after arguing that the pitch should have been called a strike.</p>
<p>Betts later gave Boston a 5-3 lead with an RBI single in the eighth inning.</p>
<p>The Yankees now face an uncertain future, as many of their most important players are set to become free agents this offseason.</p>

<h1 id="Boston-Red-Sox-one-win-away-from-claiming-first-pennant-in-five-years"><a href="#Boston-Red-Sox-one-win-away-from-claiming-first-pennant-in-five-years" class="headerlink" title="Boston Red Sox one win away from claiming first pennant in five years"></a>Boston Red Sox one win away from claiming first pennant in five years</h1><p>The Boston Red Sox have reached the American League Championship Series (ALCS) for the first time since 2013 and currently lead the Houston Astros 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. The Red Sox are just one win away from claiming their first pennant in five years, which would also give them home field advantage throughout the World Series.</p>
<p>Boston has been led by star players Mookie Betts and J.D. Martinez, both of whom were acquired prior to the 2018 season. Martinez has been especially impressive, hitting .333 with two home runs and five RBIs in the ALCS.</p>
<p>The Astros will be looking to get back into the series in Game 4, which is scheduled for Tuesday night. Houston starter Justin Verlander is coming off a dominant performance in Game 1 of the series, in which he allowed just one run over six innings while striking out 10 batters.</p>
