      Study Shows Pennsylvania Casinos May Be Cheating Players

        <h1 id="Study-Shows-Pennsylvania-Casinos-May-Be-Cheating-Players"><a href="#Study-Shows-Pennsylvania-Casinos-May-Be-Cheating-Players" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Pennsylvania Casinos May Be Cheating Players"></a>Study Shows Pennsylvania Casinos May Be Cheating Players</h1><p>A recent study conducted by two professors at the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that casinos in Pennsylvania may be cheating players. The study, which will be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Gambling Studies, looked at nearly 1.5 million betting patterns from 2014 to 2016 at 12 casinos in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The study found that the casinos were more likely to win when players bet on blackjack and roulette. In fact, the casinos won more than they should have when players bet on blackjack, and they won almost twice as much as they should have when players bet on roulette.</p>
<p>“The fact that the house edge was increased for blackjack and roulette suggests that casino personnel may be manipulating the games in favor of the house,” said study co-author Dr. Michael Shafer.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that concerns have been raised about cheating at Pennsylvania casinos. In 2016, a group of gamblers filed a lawsuit against three casinos in Pennsylvania, claiming that the casinos were using illegal methods to tilt the odds in their favor.</p>
<p>Casino officials deny any wrongdoing, and say that the findings of the UMass Amherst study are flawed. They maintain that the House Edge is always in favor of the casino, and that no manipulation is taking place.</p>
<p>Regardless of who is right and who is wrong, this study is sure to cause concerns among players who gamble at Pennsylvania casinos. If you’re one of those players, it might be a good idea to keep an eye on your betting patterns and see if you start losing more often than you should be.</p>
<h1 id="State’s-Gaming-Control-Board-Launches-Investigation-Into-Alleged-Cheating"><a href="#State’s-Gaming-Control-Board-Launches-Investigation-Into-Alleged-Cheating" class="headerlink" title="State’s Gaming Control Board Launches Investigation Into Alleged Cheating"></a>State’s Gaming Control Board Launches Investigation Into Alleged Cheating</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board has launched an investigation into allegations of cheating at the state’s largest casino.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Board, the investigation was launched after several employees of the casino filed a complaint alleging that members of a high-stakes poker game had been cheating.</p>
<p>The Board did not release any details about the alleged cheating, but said that it was “significant enough” to warrant an investigation.</p>
<p>“The Nevada Gaming Control Board takes any allegation of cheating seriously,” said Board Chairman A.G. Burnett in a statement. “We are committed to ensuring the integrity of our gaming industry and will conduct a full and thorough investigation into these allegations.”</p>
<p>The casino declined to comment on the allegations, but said that it was cooperating fully with the Board’s investigation.</p>
<h1 id="Officials-Suspect-Insider-Cheating-at-Some-Pennsylvania-Casinos"><a href="#Officials-Suspect-Insider-Cheating-at-Some-Pennsylvania-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Officials Suspect Insider Cheating at Some Pennsylvania Casinos"></a>Officials Suspect Insider Cheating at Some Pennsylvania Casinos</h1><p>Pennsylvania casino regulators believe that cheating may be taking place at some casinos in the state. The officials have not released the names of the casinos or exactly how the cheating is taking place, but they believe that it is happening largely due to people with inside information.</p>
<p>One theory is that employees of the casinos are tipping off friends or family members about which slot machines are likely to pay out and then those people are playing those machines and winning large sums of money. Another possibility is that someone is getting access to the casino’s computer systems and manipulating the odds in their favor.</p>
<p>Regulators say that they have been investigating this issue for some time now and that they have identified several potential instances of cheating. However, they have not yet been able to confirm any allegations. In the meantime, they are urging casino operators to increase their security measures and be on the lookout for any suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many people, as Pennsylvania casinos are typically considered to be very secure. In fact, most of the cheating that does take place in casinos tends to happen in offshore establishments where security is not as tight.</p>
<p>Regulators believe that this development could impact the state’s casino industry, as players may start to become more wary about gambling at Pennsylvania casinos. This could result in a decline in revenue for these establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-at-Alleged-Cheating-Casino-Fired-After-Being-Caught"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-at-Alleged-Cheating-Casino-Fired-After-Being-Caught" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer at Alleged Cheating Casino Fired After Being Caught"></a>Blackjack Dealer at Alleged Cheating Casino Fired After Being Caught</h1><p>The blackjack dealer at an alleged cheating casino has been fired after being caught. Management at the casino say that they have a zero tolerance policy for cheating and that the dealer will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>The casino has refused to name the dealer, but say that they are a woman in her mid-thirties. She is said to have been caught on camera dealing cards from the bottom of the deck. This is a well known cheating technique that can give players an advantage by allowing them to see which cards are coming next.</p>
<p>The dealer was caught during a routine inspection by management and was immediately fired. She is now facing criminal charges for cheating and could spend time in prison if found guilty.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that allegations of cheating have been made against this casino. In fact, it has been long rumoured that the casino is rigged in favour of the house. This latest incident is likely to only add to those rumours.</p>
<p>Management at the casino have denied all allegations of cheating and insist that their games are fair and honest. However, many players will now be questioning whether or not they can trust this establishment.</p>
<h1 id="Audit-Finds-Patterns-of-Suspected-cheating-at-some-Pennsylvania-casinos"><a href="#Audit-Finds-Patterns-of-Suspected-cheating-at-some-Pennsylvania-casinos" class="headerlink" title="Audit Finds Patterns of Suspected cheating at some Pennsylvania casinos"></a>Audit Finds Patterns of Suspected cheating at some Pennsylvania casinos</h1><p>The Pennsylvania Auditor General released the results of an audit last week that found patterns of suspected cheating at some state-licensed casinos.</p>
<p>The audit focused on the use of devices such as card counting tools and ‘followers’ who observe game play and signal potential winning bets to players.</p>
<p>It identified 34 instances of suspected cheating at seven casinos over a two-year period. In each case, casino security had already identified the players involved and taken action, including barring them from the casino.</p>
<p>The audit makes a series of recommendations to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB), including:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthening procedures to identify and investigate suspected cheating</li>
<li>providing more training to casino staff on how to identify cheating</li>
<li>developing guidelines for when and how casino security should intervene.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a statement, PGCB said it “will give serious consideration” to the recommendations. It also noted that the board has “a robust compliance program in place that includes measures specifically designed to prevent and detect cheating”.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s casino industry is worth around $2.5 billion annually, with 10 casinos currently operating in the state.</p>
